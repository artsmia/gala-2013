					<h1>Preserving our Masterpieces</h1>
					<p>The night of the Gala, guests will be invited to support the MIA's critical and ongoing art conservation needs. With a permanent collection of more than 83,000 works of art, the MIA values conservation as a vital part of its mission: To enrich the community by collecting, preserving, and making accessible outstanding works of art from the world's diverse cultures.</p>
					<p>The museum strives to preserve and present the works of art it holds in trust in their best possible condition. From restoring Renaissance paintings, to repairing marble sculpture, to cleaning treasures from around the world, the MIA's curators, staff, and conservators devote countless hours to the conservation of art.  
					<p>Your support of this effort will provide critical funding to conserve more works in the collection and make them available to visitors.</p>
